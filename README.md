# superpi

### Summary:

This repository contains files to setup a minimal snes9x-based SNES emulator alternative to Retro-Pi. Most notably, a libevdev & ncurses boot menu is provided allowing the emulator to be navigated from boot entirely using a controller.


### Requirements:

- A gamepad compatible with the kernel's joystick driver (`joydev`).
